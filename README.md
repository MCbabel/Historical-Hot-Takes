# Historical Hot Takes ðŸ”¥

A web application that uses Grok 4's action chain capabilities to generate a witty debate between two historical figures on a modern topic.

This project was created for the Vibe Coding with Grok 4 bounty.

**Powered by AI ML API**

## How it Works

This application has two modes:

### Solo Hot Take
1.  **Choose One Figure:** Select a historical figure from the first dropdown. Leave the second dropdown as "-- None --".
2.  **Enter a Topic:** Type in any modern topic.
3.  **Generate:** Click the button to get a single, witty "hot take" from your chosen figure.

### Historical Debate
1.  **Choose Two Figures:** Select two different historical figures from the dropdown lists.
2.  **Enter a Topic:** Type in any modern topic.
3.  **Generate:** Click the button to trigger an AI Action Chain:
    *   First, it generates a "hot take" from the first figure.
    *   Then, it feeds that response to the AI to generate a witty rebuttal from the second figure.
    *   The full debate is then displayed.
